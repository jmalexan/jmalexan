                Here's a brief summary of some of the larger projects I've worked on in industry, academia, and as hobby
                projects, listed in order of recency.  Use these shortcuts to jump to a specific project, if convenient:

                Most recently I've been focusing on several Virtual Reality related academic projects. The first is a
                psychology study and honor's college thesis with the Oregon State University's CARVE Lab in the
                Psychology department, under Dr. Kristen Macuga. This study looks to investigate how people estimate
                distances traveled while moving through a virtual environment. The concept, background literature
                research, and software used in the study were all created primarily by me with significant help from Dr.
                Macuga and the rest of the CARVE lab.

                The other is my virtual reality work with Dr. Raffaele De Amicis for my master's research. With him I've
                been exploring technologies for visualizing data within virtual reality, specifically geographic data
                and graph data. I built a high fidelity geographic data visualization that recreated the town of
                Seaside, OR, and simulated the effects of a tsunami effecting the town using a pre-generated dataset.
                More recently, I've been working with him to build a graph data visualization software that utilizes
                virtual reality and 3D space to display data in ways that are intuitive to understand and interact with.

                Over summer 2020, I had the opportunity to work in a compiler group at NVIDIA implementing new
                functionality into their build scripts. This functionality took the form of an optional flag on the
                build scripts to enable code sanitizers in the compiler executable itself. In addition to implementing
                this functionality, I took the output from those sanitizers to fix several memory-related errors in the
                codebase. My work helped to make the compiler more performant and secure, as well as prepared a tool to
                detect issues for use after I'm gone.

                Since 2018 I've been part of a team working on a project to gather and display information from the game
                Destiny 2. The core feature is a website that displays the location of a vendor in the game that moves
                around weekly, and can only be found by manually checking every location he could possibly be placed.
                This information is displayed on the website alongside other pieces of relevant info about the game's
                state for the current day, and done with a large focus on comedy in flavortext. There's also a Discord
                bot that allows communities to sign up for an automatic message when the vendor is found at his new
                location, and social media accounts for interacting with the Destiny 2 community at large. The site is
                popular (50K monthly users!), and has earned a reputation in the community for being a beloved
                hidden gem among the fan developed tools for the game.
