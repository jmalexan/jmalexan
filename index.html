                Hey, how's it going? I'm Jonathan Alexander, and I'm a software engineer.
            </div>

                I've had a lot of experience with developing different kinds of software, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Both frontend and backend web development.</li>
                    <li>DevOps work supporting a compiler focused team.</li>
                    <li>Chatbot development for use on personal messaging groups.</li>
                </ul>
                If you want to check out some of my projects, and what I've been working on recently, head over to my

                I help run a pretty popular (50K users a month!) website centered around Bungie's game Destiny 2, which
                delivers information about vendor locations and inventories within the game, and does so with a dose of
                comedy. Fair warning, we curse a lot and have a pretty non-work-safe sense of humor! You can check it
                out <a href="https://wtfix.gg/">here</a>, or read more about it on my <a href="/projects.html">Projects
                    page</a>!

                I've also had a lot of experience working in industry through multiple summer internships in highschool
                and college. This has involved working in teams, and working completely independently, each with
                satisfactory results. If you want to take a look at my work experience, you can checkout my <a
